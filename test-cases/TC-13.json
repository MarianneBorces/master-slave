They are not checklists for classroom visits. To knowledgeably fill out therubrics, principals need to have been in classrooms frequently throughout the year; it is irresponsible to fill out therubrics based on one classroom observation. Unannounced mini-observations every 2-3 week followed by face-to-faceconversations are the best way for principals to have an accurate sense of teachers’ performance, give formative praiseand suggestions, and listen to push-back.","templateAttachments":[{"name":"9th Grade Extended Classroom: Understanding Linear Equations","type":1},{"name":"9th Grade Extended Classroom: Understanding Linear Equations","type":1},{"name":"Archive: 4th Grade: Discussing Details in a Novel","type":1},{"name":"Classic: Classroom Strategies for Heterogeneity","type":1}]},{"type":5,"questionText":"The Highly Effective level is reserved for truly outstanding teaching that meets very demanding criteria; there will berelatively few ratings at this level.
